# masterschool_capstone_project
This is a project, I did during my time at masterschool, combining SQL, spreadsheets and Tableau to analyze some data of the fictive company 'unicorn'.  
  
<ul>
<li> Part 1 was the SQL part. I answered some questions about unicorn using queries on the database Unicorn-1.db. </li>
<li> In part 2 I build a little interactive dashboard in MS Excel showing the user some KPIs based on a specific year he can choose from a dropdown menu. </li>
<li> Part 3 was the Tableau part and the most creative one. I had to choose a question to answer na then answer it. I focussed on losses generated by too high discounts on orders in some countries. I provide the data (capstone.csv) and the slides of the presentation in this repo. The actual story can be seen

</ul>
